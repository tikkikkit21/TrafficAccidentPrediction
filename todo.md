This is just a small file to track things I want to do in the future, whether for
milestone or final project.

- Handle missing values
- Add feature for geographical location (east, west, midwest, etc.)
    - This might replace timezone
- Add feature for morning/night
    - I'm thinking of having noon be the middle ground, see if maybe accidents occur mostly in early morning/late evening
- Create polar histogram
    - Use a polar histogram to visualize accident frequency around the clock
