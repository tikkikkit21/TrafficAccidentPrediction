# Traffic Accident Prediction
We split up our project into multiple sections, each with their corresponding notebook.
Here is some more information:

- `process_dataset.ipynb`
    - Run this notebook FIRST
    - Data cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values
- `numerical_analysis.ipynb`
    - Conducts numerical analysis on the data's features and distribution
- `visualizations.ipynb`
    - Visualizes the data with graphs
- `machine_learning2.ipynb`
    - Trains several supervised learning classifiers
    - Compares results and reports accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    - **Warning:** running can take a couple *hours*

All libraries we use are in our `requirements.txt` file.
